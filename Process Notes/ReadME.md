My decision making process discussion is enclosed in my Paradata document. 

## Building a Hologram Projector

Once I decided on what I actually wanted to produce for this module, I starting making the plastic hologram projector that I would need in order to create a hologram. I figured that making this first was the best course of action because it would allow me to test it out with pre-existing hologram videos on YouTube, and allow me to ensure that it works before I start making my own hologram video. 
I put my crafting and DIY skills to test and scavenged an old CD case to cut up and use for this project. I followed the instructions set out on this website -> https://makerbus.blog/2018/01/19/building-a-diy-smartphone-hologram-projector-is-it-as-cool-as-the-internet-makes-it-look/ . The tutorial was easy follow and the overall task is quite simple. I opted to use CD case for the plastic instead of the thick, industrial grade plastic that was used in the tutorial because the CD case was easily available to me, and I had the time to spend cutting it. 

I first created a paper template of a trapezoid that measured 1cm on the top, 4.5 cm on the sides, and 6 cm along the bottom. I then taped the template onto the CD case plastic and traced around it in pen so that I had an outline to follow when cutting. I laid out the templates so that each sides were touching in order to maximize the efficiency of my cutting. 

The plastic was, in no doubt, difficult to cut. I sliced along the lines multiple times with an X-acto knife, applying as much force as I could so that each slice would slowly dig further into the plastic. Once I decided that I had cut into the plastic deep enough, I lined the cutting edge along the side of the table and used pliers to carefully break plastic along the straight edge. I have never cut thick plastic or glass before, but I knew that theoretically, this was the best way to do it.  Most cuts and breaks came out fairly well, although I did have some corner piece casualties. Luckily these were the top corners, and it would not affect the overall projection. I then sanded down the edges so that they were not so jagged and sharp, and I carefully tapped the pieces together to form an inverted pyramid. I was especially careful with the tape as I did not want dirty tape obscuring the view of the hologram. 

I tested out the hologram projector with some videos on YouTube and it worked perfectly! It was definitely mesmerising to watch. I discovered that the best way to view the hologram is by being in a dark room and turning the phone brightness all the way up. 


## Creating a Hologram Video

This was the part of the project I was dreading, as I had no idea of how to go about it at first. All I knew was that I somehow needed to get a synchronized, moving video of my 3D model. I had no idea how to render my model into a video at first, and no amount of googling really helped. All of the articles that came up provided instructions on how to make a video into a 3D model…so it was not quite what I wanted. I looked to Sketchfab to see if there were any applications available through there, and there were none that I could find. I figured that my next plan would be to screen record myself manually manipulating my Sketchfab model, and using that video file. 

In order to do this, I had to figure out how to screen record (something so simple and yet I had no idea how to do it.) After some googling I found out that a screen recording application comes already installed on Windows 10 devices, and works through Xbox Live. All I had to do to bring it up was hit the windows button + the “G” key at the same time. After hitting one button, I was then set to record. After stopping the recording, the video would save automatically, and was accessed through This PC > Videos > Captures.  To get my 3D model video, I went onto SketchFab and made the viewer full screen, and recorded myself manually spinning my model to reveal all sides and angles. While crude and somewhat simplistic, I think it worked quite well and the cursor is only slightly visible but not overly distracting.

The second portion of this endeavour required me to reflect the video four ways and have them all play consecutively. While researching how to do this I discovered this amazing tutorial that teaches you how to do this in POWERPOINT.

This was fantastic as it allowed me to do everything I needed, in an application that I am already very familiar with, therefore I would not have to download new software and learn a new editing interface. 

The tutorial is quite straightforward and easy to follow, and I only had difficulties with the step that teaches you how to sync the videos. After some fiddling around I got that hang of it. I also used a triangle shape as a guide in order to ensure that the videos are positioned the same distance away from the center point. I would align the triangle with the X cross section guide and align the bottom of the videos with the straight edge of the triangle (this can be seen in the images linked in the Object Files). 

In order to save the video, I needed to export the file as an MP4 video file. I saved the video in a low quality as it was intended to be viewed on a phone and because the synced the videos did not play smoothly while on a high resolution. 

Once finalized, I sent to video to myself so that I could open it on my phone and VOILA! It worked! It was rather tiny (as the boxes could not fit any more into the frame) but it worked. I did notice, however, that it was not as easy to view as the YouTube examples were. This was because the background was grey, and not completely black, because of the default Sketchfab background. I hoped that a grey background would not be a problem but a black background turned out to be necessary for optimal viewing. 

I figured out how to change the background in Sketchfab by going into “3D Settings” and changing the background colour to black. After I did this, I recorded a new video and repeated the entire video making process. My final video turned out WAY better and my tiny Brillo Soap Pad Boxes can now be viewed spinning around in virtual space.

A recording of my hologram in action can be viewed in my Object Files folder.
