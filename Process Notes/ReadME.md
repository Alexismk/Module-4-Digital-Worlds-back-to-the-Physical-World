## Building a Hologram Projector

Once I decided on what I actually wanted to produce for this module, I starting making the plastic hologram projector that I would need in order to create a hologram. I figured that making this first was the best course of action because it would allow me to test it out with pre-existing hologram videos on YouTube, and allow me to ensure that it works before I start making my own hologram video. 
I put my crafting and DIY skills to test and scavenged an old CD case to cut up and use for this project. I followed the instructions set out on this website -> https://makerbus.blog/2018/01/19/building-a-diy-smartphone-hologram-projector-is-it-as-cool-as-the-internet-makes-it-look/ . The tutorial was easy follow and the overall task is quite simple. I opted to use CD case for the plastic instead of the thick, industrial grade plastic that was used in the tutorial because the CD case was easily available to me, and I had the time to spend cutting it. 

I first created a paper template of a trapezoid that measured 1cm on the top, 4.5 cm on the sides, and 6 cm along the bottom. I then taped the template onto the CD case plastic and traced around it in pen so that I had an outline to follow when cutting. I laid out the templates so that each sides were touching in order to maximize the efficiency of my cutting. 

The plastic was, in no doubt, difficult to cut. I sliced along the lines multiple times with an X-acto knife, applying as much force as I could so that each slice would slowly dig further into the plastic. Once I decided that I had cut into the plastic deep enough, I lined the cutting edge along the side of the tape and used pliers to break to carefully break plastic along the straight edge. I have never cut think plastic or glass before, but I knew that theoretically, this was the best way to do it.  Most cuts and breaks came out fairly well, although I did have some corner pierce casualties. Luckily these were the top corners, and it would not affect the overall projection. I then sanded down the edges so that they were not so jagged and sharp, and I carefully tapped the pieces together to form an inverted pyramid. I was especially careful with the tape as I did not want dirty tape obscuring the view of the hologram. 

I tested out the hologram projector with some videos on YouTube and it worked perfectly! It was definitely mesmerising to watch. I discovered that the best way to view the hologram is by being in a dark room and turning the phone brightness all the way up.
