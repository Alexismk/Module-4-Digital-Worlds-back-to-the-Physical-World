I have uploaded the MP4 videos in this folder as well. You will need to download the RAW file in order to view. In order to see the hologram projection better, you will also need to zoom into the video on your phone so that the images fill up the screen. 

The image file "Capture 1" shows the PowerPoint layout of my first hologram video.

The image file "Capture 2" shows the PowerPoint layout of my final video with the black background. 

In both images you can see part of my video making process that I described in my Process Notes.
