# Suggested Rubric


Given that this module was more of challenge, and lacks the same number of reading to draw upon as with other modules due to missing a few classes, I have changed the rubric so that it reflects this module fairly. 


#### 3 points for Attendance and Engagement

Marks calculated by participation and involvement in both class and online on hypothesis. I have lowered the marks slightly hear because we have missed so classes and have had less readings in this module. 


#### 5 points for Process Notes

Process Notes are necessary to explaining how I was able to achieve my virtual reality hologram. I think it is important for future reference for myself and for anyone else who wishes to do this (because I personally found it VERY cool).


#### 6 points for the Final Object 

Slightly more points should be awarded to the final object because the purpose of this module was to bring our virtual object into the physical world. This endeavour was something that I have never done before, nor did I even think it was possible to do on my own. I was able to produce my hologram by troubleshooting and researching on my own and experimenting along the way. 

Furthermore, as always, I think that the final object should be looked while keeping in mind the discussion and thoughts that were set out in the Paradata, and should be marked on how well the object conveys these thoughts. 


#### 6 points for Paradata

I think that the marking of the paradata should take into consideration the thought process behind the work and how our class discussions throughout the semester has come to influence and inform our decision making process in regards to our final product. 
As with the previous module, I think that the relationship of our topic to the way the way we decided to render it should be considered, as not all forms of VR or alternate reality could produce a meaningful outcome. In addition, I think less emphasis should be placed on incorporating specific readings into our paradata, as we had less readings assigned in this module. Rather, I think that the demonstration of understanding the general concepts of this module and this course should be marked.
