# Suggested Rubric

I will only be adding a few variations to the existing rubric so that it reflects the uniqueness of this module.

5 points for attendance and engagement still seems like a very reasonable expectation, so that can stay the same.

5 points for the process notes also seem very reasonable and applicable, probably even more so in this module due to the more complicated nature of the project. In my case, I think it is necessary to explain how I figured out how to code using Tracery JSON, and how I went about coding my twitter bot so that it generated the tweets that I wanted.

I also think that 5 points for the thing itself, on the grounds that it achieved our main goal that we detailed in the Paradata. For myself, a lot of my time was spent on figuring out how to code using Tracery JSON and while my final bot is simplistic, I am actually quite proud of what I was able to accomplish. I had absolutely no idea how coding functioned before, and I am quite proud of myself for being able to actually write code now (even if it is still faulty).

I think that, as usual, there should be 5 points for Paradata, however I think the expectations within the paradata should be altered slightly. Given that we have all selected objects at the beginning of the semester that we have been restricted to this entire time and the histories associated with our objects are so vastly different, judging our final product on the same criteria would not be fair. Therefore, I propose that we still be marked on thought process behind our work, with more focus on how we made the main goals of this module work with the object that we had already chosen and how we made it have meaning. I also think less emphasis should be placed on incorporating specific readings into our paradata. In my case, many of the readings did not directly apply as they all addressed history in videos games specifically, where as I created a twitter bot instead of a game. I think that in my case, more weight should be given to the intention behind the project, and how I incorporated some of the main ideas we discussed into my project. I also think that object should be graded on HOW it fosters interactivity and engagement, rather than the platform it uses to achieve that (twitter bot vs. video game). Importance should be placed in how the work makes you think of some aspect of history differently, rather than just the product itself. Just like Warhol’s art, it is what you take away from the objet, not the object itself that holds the meaning.

Final Mark Breakdown
5 points – Attendance and engagement with readings
5 points – Process notes
Detailed explanation of our work
Effort that was put in
Evidence of clearly thought out decisions.
5 points -The thing/object itself
5 points – Paradata
How we made our objects work in this module.
How we made its new form have meaning and how we made its interactive components have meaning.
Incorporation of main themes of this module.
I put a lot of thought and effort into this module and it was probably the most difficult one yet. I tried my best to produce some that works, but was also produced with deep thought and deliberate intentions which coincided with some of the main themes we discussed in class. For these reasons I feel as though I should receive a full/close to full mark that is reflective of my effort.
